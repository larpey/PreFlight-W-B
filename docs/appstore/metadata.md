## App Store Description

### Promotional Text (170 characters max — can be updated without new build)
```
The only GA weight & balance calculator that shows its sources. Verify every number against your POH. 4 aircraft included.
```

### Description (4000 characters max)
```
PreFlight W&B is a weight and balance calculator for general aviation pilots. It calculates total weight, center of gravity, and moment for your aircraft configuration — and shows you exactly where every number comes from.

TRANSPARENT CALCULATIONS
Every data point — empty weight, arm, CG envelope limit — is traced back to its source document (POH, TCDS, or AC) with section references and confidence levels. No black boxes. You can verify every number against your own Pilot's Operating Handbook.

AIRCRAFT INCLUDED
- Cessna 172M Skyhawk
- Beechcraft Bonanza A36
- Piper Cherokee Six PA-32-300
- Piper Navajo Chieftain PA-31-350

FEATURES
- Real-time weight & balance calculations as you adjust loads
- Interactive CG envelope chart showing your current position
- Save and name multiple loading scenarios
- Cloud sync across devices (optional, with free account)
- Works fully offline — no internet required for calculations
- iOS-native design with smooth animations

SAFETY FIRST
Per FAR 91.103, the pilot in command is solely responsible for determining the aircraft is within approved weight and balance limits before each flight. This app is a supplemental planning tool. Always verify against your aircraft's actual POH and most recent weight and balance record. Aircraft empty weights shown are typical values and will differ from your specific aircraft.

PRIVACY FOCUSED
- No ads, no tracking, no analytics
- Works without an account (Guest mode)
- Optional sign-in for cloud sync only
- Your data stays on your device unless you choose to sync

Built by a pilot, for pilots.
